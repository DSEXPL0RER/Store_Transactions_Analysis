# Store_Transactions_Analysis
This Python project performs market basket analysis on a grocery store dataset using the Apriori algorithm from mlxtend. It preprocesses transaction data, applies frequent itemset mining, and generates strong association rules based on support, confidence, and lift. The project also visualizes the most frequent itemsets with bar charts and explores relationships between support, confidence, and lift using scatter plots.
