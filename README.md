# Store_Transactions_Analysis
This project applies market basket analysis on a grocery store dataset using the Apriori algorithm from mlxtend. It preprocesses transactions, extracts frequent itemsets, and generates association rules using support, confidence, and lift. Results are visualized with bar charts and scatter plots, highlighting top item associations and insights.
